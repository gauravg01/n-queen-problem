#N Queen Problem using java

This is a classing example of n queen problem which I have solved using steepest ascent hill climbing algorithm and hill climbing algorithm with sideways approach.

In N Queen Problem, we try to place N queens on the chess board in such a manner that they don't attack each other.

In our example, I have hardcoded the N value to be 8

Just run the NQueensProblem.java file and enter the number of attemps you want it to perform

For each run, it will calculate the success rate, failure rate, and the success average, failure average

Success rate: From the total number of runs, how may times it got success
Failure rate: From the total number of runs, how many times it got failed
Success average: How many steps on an average it took when it was success
Failure average: How many steps on an average it took when it got failed
